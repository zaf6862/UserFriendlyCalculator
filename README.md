# UserFriendlyCalculator
This repo contains a python program that allows users to enter mathematical expressions as human-readable strings and get their answers. 

This is basically a gutted-out version of the eval() function available in most programming languages. 

To use the calculator, make sure you have python3 installed and setup on your machine. Once you have that, clone the repository and navigate to the folder where it is cloned. Then run the following command:

```
  python3 RunMe.py
```

You can type "help" to get to know the calculator a little better. 

Happy calculating.
